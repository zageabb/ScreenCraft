# ScreenCraft development register
**Status 2026-11-12:** Documentation-first. No working editor, importer, exporter or runtime CI evidence.
**Evidence rule:** Track implementation, local validation, CI, merge, deployment and user acceptance separately. Never mark documentation-only work as runtime complete.

## Standards adoption
- Source: zageabb/Application-Standard, proposed v1.0 baseline; profile P6 design tooling with P3 editor characteristics.
- Copied master standard, reusable screen/proxy/integration/reuse guidance, QA and templates.
- Adaptation: Flask plus JavaScript allowed; Figma optional; no private corporate screenshots or official brand token claims.
- Review and CI evidence pending on this branch. Documentation checks alone do not demonstrate a working editor.
- User manual: docs/USER_MANUAL.md records not yet released; update in every future user-visible feature change.
- Source discussion and feature details: docs/INITIAL_IDEA.md.

## Interactive prototype extension — 2026-11-12 (proposal)
See [docs/INTERACTIVE_PROTOTYPE_PROPOSAL.md](docs/INTERACTIVE_PROTOTYPE_PROPOSAL.md) for requirements, acceptance criteria and phased delivery.
- SC-002: portable versioned application document schema; .scraft ZIP with PNG/SVG/JPEG and editable screen/component trees.
- SC-003: PostgreSQL-backed multi-user project and prototype mock-data API; SQLite only as optional single-user development mode.
- SC-004: evaluate React/TypeScript + native HTML5 DOM renderer and drag/drop library for full editing/preview parity.

- SC-015: Prototype-only declarative interaction engine — PLANNED.
